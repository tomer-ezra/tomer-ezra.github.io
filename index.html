    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (<a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">CMSA</a>) at Harvard University under the mentorship of <a href="https://yannai.gonch.name/scientific/" target="_blank">Yannai A. Gonczarowski</a>. 
<br>
Before that, I was the
<a href="https://www.slmath.org/fall-2023-supported-scholars" target="_blank">Sloan Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (<a href="https://www.slmath.org/" target="_blank">SLMath</a>) where I took part in the semester program on <a href="https://www.slmath.org/programs/333" target="_blank">Mathematics and Computer Science of Market and Mechanism Design</a>. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Sapienza University of Rome, hosted by <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/uniroma1.it/stefanoleonardi-eng/home" target="_blank">Stefano Leonardi</a>.
<br><br>
I received my PhD from Tel Aviv University where I was advised by <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mfeldman/" target="_blank">Michal Feldman</a>.  My research interests lie in the border of Computer Science and Economics, focusing on the analysis and design of simple mechanisms and algorithms in limited information settings.
